A framework for building in-browser data-based presentations.

## Motivation
The web browser is a dedicated communication tool. With the rise of powerful data-driven Javascript libraries, the web browser is also a tool for data visualization.

## Current functionality
- Slide navigation using arrow keys or space-bar
- Hide slides by pressing B on the keyboard
- Smooth transitions
- Title slide layout
- Single- and two-column text-only layout
- Single scatter plot layout, reading data from CSV

## To come
- A multitude of layouts
- Within-slide transitions
- "Sticky" elements that remain between slide transitions
- Data-aware chart embedding and animation
- Slide navigation by keying number
- Export to PDF
